Rayex provides Elixir NIF bindings to [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/)

> WIP: many of the functions on raylib are yet not implemented, check the [contributing section](#contributing) to help

## Installation

The package can be installed by adding `rayex` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:rayex, "~> 0.0.1"}
  ]
end
```

The docs can be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/rayex](https://hexdocs.pm/rayex).

## How to run

You need the following deps installed on your system:
* elixir
* raylib v4.0
* pkg-config

Note: If you are using Nix or NixOS you can run __nix-shell__ to get an ready to go env to work on!

Now you can run:
```bash
mix deps.get
iex -S mix
```

Testing Rayex
```elixir
# Import all modules
use Rayex

# open new window
init_window 200, 200, "window name"

# draw a line
begin_drawing
draw_line 10, 10, 50, 51, %{r: 255, g: 161, b: 0, a: 255}
end_drawing
```

Also you can run our examples!!

## Contributing

There are a few things that you need to know about the code:
* This project aims to run each one of [those functions](https://www.raylib.com/cheatsheet/cheatsheet.html) with elixir
* To do so, we are using [Unifex](https://hexdocs.pm/unifex/readme.html) to create NIFs
* On `c_src/rayex/rayex.spec.exs` you can find the definitions that will be generated by Unifex
* On `c_src/rayex/rayex.c` you can find how they are implemented
* On `c_src/rayex/rayex.h` and `lib/unifex/code_generator/base_types/...` you can find custom types
* On `lib/rayex/unifex/raylib.ex` is where the generated functions will be stored and used for each module under `lib/rayex`, the public API

Any contributions are appreciated
