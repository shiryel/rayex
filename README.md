Rayex provides Elixir NIF bindings to [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/)

> WIP: many of the functions on raylib are yet not implemented, check the [contributing section](#contributing) to help

## Installation

The package can be installed by adding `rayex` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:rayex, "~> 0.0.2"}
  ]
end
```

The docs can be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/rayex](https://hexdocs.pm/rayex).

## Running from source

You need the following packages installed on your system:
* elixir
* erlang (headers)
* pkg-config
* raylib v4.2
* glibc
* clang-tools (formatter)

> If you are using Nix or NixOS you can run __nix develop__ to get an ready to go env to work with!

Now you can run:
```bash
mix deps.get
iex -S mix
```

And test with:
```exs
# Import all modules
iex> use Rayex

# open new window
iex> init_window(200, 200, "window name")

# draw a line
iex> begin_drawing()
iex> draw_line(10, 10, 50, 51, %{r: 255, g: 161, b: 0, a: 255})
iex> end_drawing()
```

You can also run our examples!!

```bash
cd examples/3d_picking/
mix deps.gen
iex -S mix
```
```exs
iex> The3dPicking.run()
```

## Contributing

There are a few things that you need to know about the code:
* This project aims to run each one of [those functions](https://www.raylib.com/cheatsheet/cheatsheet.html) with elixir
* To do so, we are using [Unifex](https://hexdocs.pm/unifex/readme.html) to create NIFs
* On `c_src/rayex/rayex.spec.exs` you can find the definitions that will be generated by Unifex
* On `c_src/rayex/rayex.c` you can find how they are implemented
* On `c_src/rayex/rayex.h` and `lib/unifex/code_generator/base_types/...` you can find custom types
* On `lib/rayex/unifex/raylib.ex` is where the generated functions will be stored and used for each module under `lib/rayex`, the public API

Any contributions are appreciated
